.SH "NAME"
MiniRC \- A minimalist init system using \fBbusybox\fR
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.sp
The default headers will provide simple, sane defaults, but users should expect to customize the setup to their liking\&.
.sp
.SH "WINDOW LAYOUTS"
\fBAlopex\fR offers three window layouts\&: rstack, bstack and monocle\&. Both stack modes divide the screen into two sections, the master region and the stack\&. Monocle keeps the screen unified in one region\&. All layouts render a tab per-client to the right of the tags and the left of the statusbar\&.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fIrstack\fR    \-\-  master on left, stack on right; clients stack vertically
\fIbstack\fR    \-\-  master on top, stack on bottom; clients stack horizontally
\fImonocle\fR   \-\-  master region fills the screen
.fi
.sp
.RE
These three layouts are further supplemented by transient, floating and fullscreen modes\&.
.sp
.SH "THEMES"
Themes for \fBalopex\fR are sets of standard \fI#RRGGBB\fR hex codes assigned to various parts of the interface\&. By default, two themes are provided called "WinterCoat" and "SummerCoat" with several others under construction\&. However, through creating a custom theme\&.h located at \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alopex/theme\&.h\fR or \fI$HOME/.alopex_theme.h\fR, creating custom themes is very simple\&.
.sp
.SH "STATUSBAR"
A single argument can be passed to \fBalopex\fR to render a statusbar\&. To avoid a CPU race, \fBalopex\fR creates a simple statusbar displaying a clock\&. However, by passing a script or program that can output text (such as conky), far more complex statusbars can be used easily\&.
.sp
In this text output, colors and icons can be specified through simple bracketed codes\&. Color codes, when passed, will color all text (and icons) following them until another color code is encountered\&. They are called in the following manner\&:
.sp
.RS 4
{#RRGGBB}
.sp
#RRGGBB is a standard hex color-code
.RE
.sp
In a similar manner, minimalist icons may be rendered on the statusbar\&. Icons are called in the following manner\&:
.sp
.RS 4
{i #}
.sp
# should be replaced by the number of the icon as designated by the array at the bottom of icons\&.h\&.
.sp
.RE
.SH "MULTIHEAD SETUP"
\fBAlopex\fR offers support for 16 external displays\&. Auto\-detection and setup of external displays is not supported, but is planned for a future release\&.
.sp
Along with being assigned to tags, each client is given an identifier which determines on what display the client will appear\&. Should the number applied to the client exceed the number of the highest display available, that client will appear on the highest numbered display available\&.
